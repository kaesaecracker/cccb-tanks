A tank game for the CCCB Airport Display.

By Felix and [Stephen](https://github.com/increpare).

### Running the server

Build an image using podman: `make container-image`

Run it locally: `make start`

### Ideas
- Make the tank slower when you shoot (Denis)
- Stable Sort the Scoreboard so that the first person getting the high score stays on top until someone scores higher
- Only allow firing while not moving (vinzenz)
- limited fire rate (vinzenz)
- delay before respawning or press R to respawn (vinzenz)
- external display emulator, the one written for Java 1.6 seems to be lost (vinzenz)
