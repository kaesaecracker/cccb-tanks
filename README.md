A tank game for the CCCB Airport Display.

By Felix and [Stephen](https://github.com/increpare).

### Running the server

Build an image using podman: `make container-image`

Run it locally: `make start`

### Ideas
- Make the tank slower when you shoot (Denis)
- Stable Sort the Scoreboard so that the first person
  getting the highscore stays on top until someone
  scores higher
